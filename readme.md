# Â¿What?

Rampcode is a vim + puredata implementation of bytebeat technique created by Viznut.  This means you need **Bash, Vim and Pure Data** to run this program.

There are plenty of bytebeat programs out there prettier than this one but Rampcode is focused on two main things:

+ Live-coding enviroment for gigs

+ Technical explanations not available anywhere else

So, if you really want to go deep into bytebeat synthesis and understand what's happening this will be ok for you.

Open pdvimbytebeat.pd patch, then open the guide file in Vim.

There is, also, an array-feature guide and script (more CPU expensive).

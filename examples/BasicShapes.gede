($v1%64/64)*0.1 ($v1%(t*4)<t) 2,

($v1%64<32)*0.1 ($v1%(t*4)<(t*2)&&$v1%(t*4)>t) 2,

sin($v1/7)*0.1 ($v1%(t*4)<(t*3)&&$v1%(t*4)>(t*2)) 2,

sin($v1*sin($v1))*0.1 ($v1%(t*4)>(t*3)) 2,

end;

Don't panic, just take a look at the expressions before *0.1.

1. SAW WAVE $v1%x/x
2. SYMETRIC SQUARE WAVE $v1%x<(x/2)
3. SINE WAVE sin($v1/x)
4. NOISE sin($v1*sin($v1))

Actually, *0.1 is the amplitude and the rest is the most complicated way to trigger one wave per pattern.

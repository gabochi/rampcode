ramp 0.86;

code 

sin($v1/8)*($v1%(t*2)%6000<1000)*0.8 8 4,

sin($v1+sin($v1)*20)*0.12 8+($v1%(t*4)>t*3)*2 8 -0.1,

sin($v1*sin($v1))*0.15 4*($v1%t<4000)+($v1%(t*8)<t)*8 8 0.1,

sin($v1/32+sin($v1/32)*sin($v1/1000)*12)*0.1 4 2,

end;

Well, things went complex... keep in mind that t=8000 and means a cycle or a pattern.
Also you should know that logical expressions like X<Y return 1 if true and 0 if false.
